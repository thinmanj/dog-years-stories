# About

**Dog Years** is a collection of short stories by Julio, exploring themes of time, memory, technology, and the human condition.

Inspired by the literary style of Jorge Luis Borges, these stories examine the intersection of humanity and technology—the ruins we leave behind, the certainties we abandon, and the maps we draw that can never quite capture the territory.
