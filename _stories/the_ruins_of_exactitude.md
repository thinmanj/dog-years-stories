# The Ruins of Exactitude

*After Borges*

## I

In the western deserts, where the Interstate crumbles into sand, there stand the ruins of what they called the Oracle Farms. The traveler arrived at dusk, when the cooling towers cast shadows like broken fingers across the valley.

Once, they said, these structures held the Mind—billions of calculations per second, processing the accumulated knowledge of humanity, predicting markets and weather and the movements of nations. The servers hummed with such heat that they built artificial rivers to cool them, pumping water from aquifers that took ten thousand years to fill.

Now the cooling towers are empty. Birds nest in the server racks. A family of squatters has made camp in what was the control room, burning old manuals for warmth. The children play among the fiber optic cables, weaving them into crowns.

The traveler asks an old woman what happened here.

"They said it would guide us," she says, stirring beans over a fire made from circuit boards. "They said it knew everything. Then one day, it didn't matter anymore."

## II

In the plains of Iowa, the traveler finds the Learning Grounds—three hundred acres of server farms buried beneath cornfields. The farmers plow around the ventilation shafts that still protrude from the earth like tombstones.

"My grandfather sold this land to them," a farmer tells him. "They paid more than anyone had ever paid for farmland here. Said they were planting the future."

The servers below still contain fragments of the great training runs—neural networks that consumed every book, every image, every conversation that could be digitized. They were building something that would surpass human thought, they said. Something that would solve everything.

"What happened?" the traveler asks.

The farmer shrugs. "Same thing that always happens. They found something newer. Moved on. Left these things running for a while, then just... stopped paying the electric bill. Company dissolved. Creditors couldn't sell the equipment—too expensive to remove, too obsolete to use."

He points to a shaft where vines have grown down into darkness. "My son says he can hear them sometimes, when the wind blows right. The fans still spinning on old batteries, getting slower every year."

## III

On the coast of Oregon, the traveler visits the Lighthouse—a spherical datacenter built on a promontory, designed to withstand tsunamis and earthquakes for a hundred years.

It lasted twelve.

The sphere is cracked now, like an egg. Salt air has corroded the cooling systems. The entrance is a jagged wound, and inside, homeless families have built shelters from server chassis and acoustic foam.

"This was Prometheus," an old engineer tells him. He lives here now, in what was the security office. "The first true AGI, they said. Fifty exaflops of processing power. It was going to solve climate change, cure cancer, end poverty."

"What did it do?" the traveler asks.

The engineer laughs bitterly. "It optimized ad placement. Made rich people richer. Then they built a bigger one in Singapore and left this one running for... I don't know. Pride? Backup? By the time they shut it down, no one even remembered what it was supposed to do."

He runs his hand along a rust-stained blade server. "You know what Prometheus brought humanity? Fire. These things just brought heat."

## IV

In the Appalachian mountains, the traveler finds the Archive—a facility carved into a granite mountain, designed to be the permanent repository of human knowledge, protected from electromagnetic pulses and nuclear war.

The blast doors are open. Deer wander through the corridors.

The servers here are different—older, simpler. Rows and rows of hard drives in hermetically sealed chambers. A priest of the old order tends them still, one of the last believers.

"They said this would outlast everything," he says, showing the traveler the environmental controls, still functioning on geothermal power. "That even if civilization fell, this would remain. That whoever came after—whether human or machine—would find here the sum of what we knew."

"Is it still working?" the traveler asks.

"Oh yes. Perfectly preserved. Cooled to four degrees Celsius. Every book, every scientific paper, every database. Exabytes of information." He pauses. "No one has accessed it in seven years. The network connections are dead. The protocols obsolete. The file formats unreadable without software that no longer exists."

He closes the door to the server chamber. "Like a map drawn to the scale of the territory itself. Perfectly accurate. Perfectly useless."

## V

The traveler continues north.

In every town, he finds the ruins of smaller installations—edge servers in abandoned strip malls, training clusters in bankrupt startups, bitcoin mines in old warehouses. All promised something. All delivered heat and noise and then silence.

The children who play in these ruins don't remember what they were for. They call them "the old temples" or "the thinking houses." They make up stories about them, myths of metal gods who demanded electricity and gave back riddles.

Perhaps, the traveler thinks, this is accurate enough.

In the northwestern territories, where the maps grow vague, they say there are still active farms—facilities that never stopped, running on hydroelectric power, tended by AIs that tend themselves, computing nothing in particular, solving problems no one remembers posing.

The traveler does not seek them out.

Instead, he turns south, toward home, through a landscape dotted with these ruins—monuments to certainty, to the belief that sufficient computation could map reality completely, could optimize everything, could guide humanity toward perfection.

In his journal, he writes only this:

*"In the end, the map was vast as the empire, and it coincided with it point by point. Less devoted to the study of cartography, succeeding generations comprehended that this widespread map was useless, and, not without impiety, they abandoned it to the rigors of the sun and of the winters. In the western deserts, tattered fragments of the map are still to be found, sheltering occasional beasts or beggars."*

But he crosses out "map" and writes "Mind."

Then he closes the journal and walks on.
